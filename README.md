# pl_sim_lib
Payload simulator library that simulates a fictitious detector that provides text data. PL_SIM_LIB relies on the payload simulator app (PL_SIM) to provide a ground interface and together they provide a simulation environment for the the payload manager app (PL_MGR). All three apps must be built/loaded as part of the same cFS target.
